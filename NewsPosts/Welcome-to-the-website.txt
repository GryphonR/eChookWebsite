After playing with lots of different ideas, we finally have a website! Currently under construction, but still!
<br>Currently it hosts the basic infomation on the project and the documentation. I am currently working on
integrating the telemetry aspect of eChook to bring that in house, and also to host our own forum, probably
based on Vanilla which will be familliar to any greenpower afficianado!

If you've found your way here, welcome, have a poke around, and when you find something broken, get in touch... once I've added a 'Contact Us' page anyway :)
